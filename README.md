## Week 1 - HTML & CSS

Dear Student of LiveCoding. Welcome to your very first week, we hope you are excited because we are really excited ðŸ˜ƒ

We already know that you have quite some experience with HTML & CSS because of the assignment and pre-bootcamp period. And you are probably looking forward to move on and explore/learn more. But it's essential that you have understood these concepts perfectly so you can build your future on top of them. Because you will never stop using HTML and CSS if you are a web developer ðŸ˜„ So let's explore what we are going to do this week ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

### Watching Online Resources

You will have to finish the first 5 section of your Video Course in this week. While watching the videos, you will have a bunch of assignments and you will be expected to do them before watching the solution. **It is extremely important to do these assignments by yourself.** If you can't? Please watch the solution and code along with the lecturer. When you are done, **try to do the same assignment again on your own without watching the video.**

After each assignment in the videos, please compress all your files and upload it to the Trello board.

### Assignments

In this section, we have 2 mandatory [assignments](./assignments) for you to solve. There is also a **Bonus Assignment** for the ones who wants more. We highly recommend you to solve that assignment as well to strength your skills. You will hear the deadlines for the assignments from your mentors.

Please feel free to ask any question on the #questions channel on Slack and also feel free to answer if you have answers for the questions of your colleagues. The more you help and explain the more you learn ðŸ˜‰
